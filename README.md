## My LeetCode Solutions

### I used to solve leetcode in the past and share solutions on their platform. So I thought of building this app for sharing my solutions to public.

### Run locally -

- Clone this repo
- Run `yarn install`
- Run `yarn start`

#### App should now be running on `http://localhost:3000/`

#### Visit live app - https://my-leetcode-solutions.netlify.app/
